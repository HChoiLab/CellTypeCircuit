## El-Boustani
```El-Boustani``` contains original and modified code of the grid model received from Sami El-Boustani.

Trial 3: Fixed capacitance from 0.2 to 0.25nF. Spontaneous, PV stim, and SOM Stim code.

Trial 4: Added multiplier to external stimulation. Use, for example: ```python gmult.py 0.1```, in which the default height of the Gaussian will be multiplied by the factor 0.1.

Trial 5:

Trial 6: Local/Distal ChR2 stimulation of SST/PV with contrast curves.

Trial 7: add long-range SOM connections.
